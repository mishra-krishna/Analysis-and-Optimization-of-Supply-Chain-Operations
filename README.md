## Overview

The project focuses on the analysis of a beauty products supply chain dataset to extract meaningful insights that can help in decision-making and optimization within supply chain management. Various visualizations are used to represent the findings, and a Decision Tree Regressor model is employed to identify the most impactful features on product cost and manufacturing lead time.

## Data Preparation

1. **Loading the Data**: The dataset is loaded using `pandas`.
2. **Initial Exploration**:
   - Display the first few rows and descriptive statistics.
   - Check for missing values and confirm their absence.
   - Encode categorical variables using one-hot encoding for further analysis.

## Correlation Analysis

1. **Pearson Correlation**:
   - Calculated to check for linear relationships between features.
   - Filtered values to identify significant correlations.
2. **Spearman Correlation**:
   - Calculated to check for monotonic relationships between features.
   - Filtered values to identify significant monotonic relationships.

## Data Visualization

1. **Product Quantities by Location**:
   - Bar chart showing product quantities sold by different locations.

2. **Distribution of Product Types by Customer Demographics**:
   - Pie charts displaying the distribution of product types among various customer demographics.

3. **Defect Rates by Supplier**:
   - Bar chart comparing average defect rates among different suppliers.

4. **Order Quantities by Routes and Transportation Modes**:
   - Stacked bar chart visualizing the distribution of order quantities across different routes segmented by transportation modes.

5. **Average Lead Time by Supplier and Product Type**:
   - Bar chart analyzing the average lead time for each supplier by product type.

6. **Manufacturing Costs by Product Type**:
   - Box plots showing the distribution of manufacturing costs for different product types.

7. **Product Costs by Product Type**:
   - Box plots showing the distribution of product costs for different product types.

8. **Shipping Costs vs. Order Quantities**:
   - Scatter plots exploring the relationship between shipping costs and order quantities for different carriers.

9. **Revenue Generated by Customer Demographics**:
   - Pie chart showing the revenue generated by each customer demographic.

## Feature Importance Analysis

Using a Decision Tree Regressor to identify the top features that impact:

1. **Product Costs**:
   - Determined the top 5 features affecting the cost of products.

2. **Manufacturing Lead Time**:
   - Determined the top 5 features affecting the manufacturing lead time.

## Key Insights

- **Customer Preferences**: Female customers primarily prefer skincare and cosmetic products, while male customers favor haircare products.
- **Supplier Performance**: Supplier 5 has the highest average defect rates, whereas Supplier 1 has the lowest.
- **Order Distribution**: Different transportation modes affect order quantities across various routes.
- **Lead Time Analysis**: Average lead time varies significantly by supplier and product type.
- **Cost Analysis**: Key features impacting product costs and manufacturing lead time identified using the Decision Tree Regressor.
